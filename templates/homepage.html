        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Outbox, founded by a team of developers and sustainability enthusiasts,
            manages an eco-conscious thrift clothing store (Outbox) and an accompanying café (Beanbox).
            Initially driven by a mission to promote sustainability and increase revenue,
            the company's evolution is marked by the digitalization of its thrift store into an online
            e-commerce platform. ZES³, Outbox's online application, caters to fashion enthusiasts with
            affordable and vintage clothing, prioritizing eco-friendly practices. The integration of a
            physical café exemplifies Outbox's inventive approach,
            creating a unique and environmentally conscious shopping experience.</p><br>
